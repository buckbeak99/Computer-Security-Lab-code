there was a wall ahead it began high in the air and extended upward out of sight it was riddled with holes that were the mouths of aal wondered idly how his driver could pick out one among so many there was now only blackness with nothing but the past-flashing of a colored signal light to relieve the gloom the air was full of a rushing sound gaal leaned forward against deceleration then and the taxi popped out of the tunnel and descended to ground-level once more the luxor hotel said the driver unnecessarily he helped gaal with his baggage accepted a tenth-credit tip with a businesslike air picked up a waiting passenger and was rising again in all this from the moment of debarkation there had been no glimpse of sky trantor at the beginning of the thirteenth millennium this tendency reached its climax as the center of the imperial government for unbroken hundreds of generations and located as it was toward the central regions of the galaxy among the most densely populated and industrially advanced worlds of the system, it could scarcely help being the densest and richest clot of humanity the race had ever seen its urbanization, progressing steadily had finally reached the ultimate. all the land surface of trantor square miles in extent was a single city the population at its height was well in excess of forty billions this enormous population was devoted almost entirely to the administrative necessities of empire and found themselves all too few for the complications of the task (it is to be remembered that the impossibility of proper administration of the galactic empire under the uninspired leadership of the later emperors was a considerable factor in the fall) daily fleets of ships in the tens of thousands brought the produce of twenty agricultural worlds to the dinner tables of trantor its dependence upon the outer worlds for food and indeed for all necessities of life made trantor increasingly vulnerable to conquest by siege in the last millennium of the empire the monotonously numerous revolts made emperor after emperor conscious of this and imperial policy became little more than the protection of trantor's delicate jugular vein
